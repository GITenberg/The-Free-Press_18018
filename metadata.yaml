description: 'Hilaire Belloc, a great English essayist of the 20th century, takes
  an uncompromising look at the forces working against the freedom of the press. Targeting
  financial and political influences, along with the influence of advertising, Belloc
  exposes the powers and motives responsible for the suppression of news and the manufacturing
  of opinion. Neither pie-in-the-sky idealism nor an irrational conspiracy theory,
  The Free Press is a rationally argued essay explaining the origins of those influences
  and factors that make the press less than what it should be honest: fair, and independent.
  This is a topical work written almost a century ago. Times have changed, but the
  situation has gone from bad to worse, and thus this work is even more relevant today.
  This book will be of interest to anyone, particularly the student of journalism
  and its history, who is curious about the rise of the major papers and media networks,
  and about the forces both overt and semi-covert working to shape what is reported
  and which opinions are sanctioned.'
